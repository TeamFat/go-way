Go helpers to send logs to Logmatic.io based on [Logrus lib](http://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus).

It mainly contains a proper JSON formatter and a TLS socket handler that streams logs directly to Logmatic.io - so no need to use a log shipper if you don't wan't to.

## Features

* Use the library as a wrapper for logrus. Everything is forwarded to Logmatic.io as JSON documents.
* Metas and extra attributes
* JSON formatter
* Secure connection to Logmatic (SSL)

## Usage

### Use the JSON formatter

To use the JSON formatter, simply associate it.


```go
package main

import (
  log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
  "github.com/logmatic/logmatic-go"
)

func main() {
  
	// use JSONFormatter
  	log.SetFormatter(&logmatic.JSONFormatter{})
  	  
	// log an event as usual with logrus
 	log.WithFields(log.Fields{"string": "foo", "int": 1, "float": 1.1 }).Info("My first event from golang to stdout")
}
```
You should able to see on the console the following output.
```json
{
  "date": "2016-05-10T15:48:47+02:00",
  "float":1.1,
  "int":1,
  "level":"info",
  "message":"My first ssl event from golang to stdout",
  "string":"foo"
}
```



### Stream log straight to Logmatic.io
The Logrus can be coupled to the LogmaticHook as follow:

```go
	// instantiate a new Logger with your Logmatic APIKey
  	log.AddHook(logmatic.NewLogmaticHook("<YOUR_API_KEY>"))
  
	//Don't forget to replace by the one provided on your Logmatic.io's platform.
	// log an event as usual with logrus
 	log.WithFields(log.Fields{"string": "foo", "int": 1, "float": 1.1 }).Info("My second event from golang to Logmatic")
  
}
```
With this configuration, any log coming from your Go's application will be sent to your platform and will fulfill the same format as described in the previous section.
